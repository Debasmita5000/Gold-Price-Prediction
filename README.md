# Gold-Price-Prediction

ðŸŒŸ Excited to Share My Latest Project on Time Series Forecasting! ðŸŒŸ

I am thrilled to announce the successful completion of my project, "Monthly Gold Price Prediction Using Time Series Analysis." This project focused on analyzing historical trends of monthly gold prices (1950â€“2020) and creating a predictive model for forecasting future prices using the SARIMA approach.

The process involved:
âœ… Initializing and exploring a dataset of 847 entries spanning over 70 years.
âœ… Conducting date feature engineering for seasonal trend analysis.
âœ… Visualizing historical gold price trends with insightful time-series decomposition.
âœ… Optimizing SARIMA hyperparameters, achieving a model accuracy of 97.52%.
âœ… Forecasting gold prices for the next 12 months to support investment planning.

This journey wouldn't have been possible without the invaluable guidance of my mentors, Farukh Hasmi Sir and Rakib Sir, who provided their expertise and constant encouragement throughout the project. I also extend my heartfelt gratitude to Ivy Professional School for fostering a great learning environment and equipping me with the skills to tackle real-world challenges.

This project has been a rewarding experience and has further fueled my passion for data analysis and predictive modeling.

ðŸ“Š Letâ€™s connect and discuss the potential applications of time series forecasting in financial markets and beyond!
